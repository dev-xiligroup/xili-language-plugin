xili-language lets you create and manage multilingual WP site in several languages with yours or most famous localizable themes. Ready for CMS design.

== Description ==

**xili-language provides for a bilingual (or multilingual) website an automatic selection of language (.mo) in theme according to the language of current post(s) or page. Theme's behaviour can be fully personalized through settings, hooks and api. Ready for CMS developers and designers.**

* xili-language plugin provides an automatic selection of language in theme according to the language of displayed post, series of posts, page or articles. *If the post is in gaelic, the texts of the theme will be in gaelic if the author checks the post as gaelic and if the theme contains the right .mo file for this target language.*

* A new interface with a list of titles (and links) to help you write articles and their translations.

* To help authoring, current user can choose language of his dashboard.

* xili-language select *on the fly* the multilingual .mo files present in the theme's folder (no cookies, no redirections like "301").

* xili-language uses a custom taxonomy to specify language of post, page and custom posts. **Full compatible with WP JSON REST API**

* xili-language plugin works on Wordpress installation in mono (standalone) or on one site belonging to a multisite (network) install.

* xili-language plugin works on Wordpress installation for WebApp with JSON REST API - see [changelog](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/changelog/) because [WP JSON REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) 1.2.1 in under full development but yet powerful.

* A tool to translate .po files of the theme and built .mo files (poEdit or better xili-dictionary - *see below* ).
* see [this page in wiki.xiligroup.org](http://wiki.xiligroup.org/index.php/Xili-language:_Getting_started,_prerequisites).

= What to prepare before and during installation before activating =

* if rtl languages are used, verify that theme contains rtl.css file.

= Links and documentation to read before activating =

= Themes provided as examples =
* Since WordPress 4.1, the default theme named **twentyfifteen** can be used without php coding for a multilingual site [as shown here twentyfifteen-xili](http://2015.extend.xiligroup.org).
* Other child theme examples of bundled parent themes: **twentyeleven** [twentyeleven-xili](http://2011.wpmu.xilione.com/), **twentytwelve** [twentytwelve-xili](http://2012.wpmu.xilione.com/), **twentythirteen** [twentythirteen-xili](http://2013.extend.xiligroup.org/), **twentyfourteen** [twentyfourteen-xili](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org/), **twentyfifteen** [twentyfifteen-xili](http://2015.extend.xiligroup.org/).


**TRILOGY FOR MULTILINGUAL CMS WEBSITE** including [xili-language plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/)

Please verify that you have installed the latest versions of:

* [xili-dictionary plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/): With xili-dictionary, it is easier to create or update online, via admin/dashboard UI, the files .mo of each language.
* [xili-tidy-tags plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/): With xili-tidy-tags, it is now possible to display sub-selection (cloud) of **tags** according language and semantic trans-language group (trademark,…).

= That this plugin does not =
*With around 8000 php lines, xili-language is not everything…*

* xili-language plugin **does not create additional tables in the database**, do not create cookies and only use 4 lines in Options table. xili-language simply makes proper use of the taxonomy tables and postmeta table offered by WordPress to define language and link items between them. Because xili-language plugin does not modify deeply the post edit UI, it is possible to use **iPhone / iPod Touch** Wordpress app to prepare and draft the post.

* xili-language plugin does not replace the author or the editor. No automatic translation. Content strategist is the master of the languages, the contents and the navigation inside the website. With xili-dictionary, webmaster can translate the theme's items and when .mo files are in place, xili-dictionary can be deactivated. For design, the creator is free to choose text or graphic. xili-language does not provide flags (or few as example in child-theme example like [twentytwelve-xili](http://2012.wpmu.xilione.com) )!

= Newbie, WP user, Developer,… =

* Dear **Newbie:** originally built for webmaster and developer, the plugin trilogy progress since 6 years to be more and more plug and play for newbies who can read and spend a little time mainly for translation.

* xili-language is also dedicated for theme's creator or webmaster with knowledges in CMS and WP and having (or not) tools to create .mo language files. Through API (hook), the plugin add automatic tools (or links or filters) for sidebar or top menus. Categories or Archives lists are translated also.
* xili-language provides also series of functions which can be *hooked* in the functions.php file of the theme that you create i.e. for a cms like multilingual website.

== Installation ==

READ CAREFULLY ALL THE README FILE AND PREREQUISITES

Read this [recent page](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org/en/description-and-features/xili-language-first-installation-by-vladimir/) and also [wiki](http://wiki.xiligroup.org) for older versions and features.

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-language.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no text hardcoded - and contains .mo and .po files for each target language - (application poEdit and/or plugin [xili-dictionary](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-dictionary/) can be used)
3. Verify that a domain name is defined in your theme - see note at end list below,
4. Activate the plugin through the *'Plugins'* menu in WordPress,
5. Go to the dashboard settings tab - languages - and adapt default values if necessary by adding your languages in the catalog. You can set the order (1,2,3...) of the series. (used in `language_attributes()` template_tag).
6. Modify each post by setting (checking) the language in xili-language box (under the content box) before publishing.
7. Other settings and parts (Browser detection, widgets, shortcode, template tags) see below… and examples.

Some steps to prepare a rich installation:

= Tabs of settings =

Settings are progressively reorganized in 6 tabs:

1. **Languages list**: Where you define the list of languages needed in your multilingual website.
2. **Languages front-end settings**: Where you define some rules and behaviour when visitor arrives in the website or navigates inside.
3. **Settings for experts**: Where experts are able to set and recovers previous sets. (backwards compatibility)
4. **Managing language files**: To import .mo files for theme or dashboard (if available in GlotPress or Automattic servers).
5. **Managing Authoring rules**: To define rules and settings in the dashboard side and help authoring.
6. **xili-language support**: A form to send an email to xiligroup support.

(online help on the top right tab for each settings page)

= Additional infos =

1. Before using your own theme, to understand how xili-language works, install the example child theme of one of the bundled themes like TwentyFourteen shown in this commented [demo site](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org).
2. Child of bundled themes include a navigation menu - [see links in FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/xili-language/faq/) -. In xili-language settings, it is possible to insert automatically languages list in the menu previously set by you.
3. If you are webmaster and want to add lot of personalizations in your theme, read source and visit [latest news](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org).

= Browser detection for visitors or authors =
To change the language of the frontpage according to the language of the visitor's browser, check the popup in right small box in settings.
To change the default language of a new post according to the language of the author's browser, check the popup in right small box in settings.

= xili-language and widgets =

Three widgets are created to enrich sidebar : list of languages, recent posts and recent comments with sub-selection according current language.

= xili-language and shortcode =

Shortcode to add a link to other language inside content of a post like
`[linkpost lang="fr_FR"]`
is available in a [library](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1111) in complement to xili-language.

= xili-language and template tags =

* xili-language "*translates*" template tags and permits some variations for webmasters:

The most current template tags don't need special work: `wp_list_categories()`, `wp_title()`,...

`wp_get_archives`
Possible that very special permalinks need to use hook named `xiliml_get_archives_link`. -
Sub selection of archives for `wp_get_archives()` with &lang= (see § below)

`wp_list_pages()` with optional query tag &lang=

* xili-language "*provides*" new template tags (or widgets) to solve issues from WP core or add new features for CMS:

`xili_language_list()` - outside loop (sidebar) display the languages of the site (used also by widget)

`xiliml_the_category()` - replace the_category() template tag of WP Core


improved `xiliml_the_others_posts()` function and theme tag to be used in multilingual category loop and by option (array) to return an array of linked posts in other languages (useful for CMS webmasters) (array of lang and id ) - the id is easily transformable in permalink with function `get_permalink()` when using this array.

= xili-language and specific functions =

Requires knowledges in php and WP !
After class in sources files, some functions are available - see sources for details.

* `the_curlang()` returns by default the slug of the current language of the displayed webpage (alias `xili_curlang()` since 2.11+). If param is specified, return ISO, Full Name or alias of current webpage - see sources -
* `is_xili_curlang( $lang )` tests (returns true or false) after testing language of current webpage. Param can be a language slug (as string) or a list of slugs (as an array). Example: `is_xili_curlang( 'fr_fr' )` returns true if webpage is in french - since 2.11+

* widget for recent comments that can subselect those for current language. (a function `xiliml_recent_comments()` is also available if you want to create a template tag with resulting objects array).



= Archives selection =

Archives tags is a very complex template tag in his background and not very easy source hookable. So we decided to add few features : by adding query in vars of the function, it will be possible to display a monthly list of archives for a selected language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=fr_fr')` - or the current the theme language - `wp_get_archives('..your.vars..&lang=')` -. The displayed list of links will be translated and link restrited to display only archives of this language.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[xili-dictionary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/) avoids to use poEdit to update .mo files with contents of terms of your database (categories, ...)

= What about plugin admin settings UI localization ? =

It is simple, if you have translated the settings UI of plugin in your mother language, you send us a message through the contact form that contains the link to your site where you have add the .po and .mo files. Don't forget to fill the header of the .po file with your name and email. If all is ok, the files will be added to the xili-language WP plugins repository. Because I am not able to verify the content, you remain responsible of your translation.


= What about bookmarks and sub-selection according current language of displayed loop ? =

Since version 1.8.5, xili-language has inside his class filters and actions to permit displaying sub-selection of links and bookmarks.

* case of default widget-links : in xili-language settings, only check link categories where sub-selection is wanted.
* case of template tags : `<?php wp_list_bookmarks( array( 'lang'=>the_curlang() ) ; ?>` here this new arg named *lang* is set to the current language.

Visit links list editor settings page and set for each link the language.

= What happens if frontpage is a page ? =

The page as frontpage must have its clones in each other languages. Like for posts, if the user's browser is not in the default language, xili-language will display the page in the corresponding language if set by the editor. [home page of website dev.xiligroup.com](http://dev.xiligroup.com/) uses this feature.

= How to enlarge languages list of the dashboard ? =

Since version 2.8, the current user (author) can choose language of his dashboard. To enlarge list of available languages, you must upload the xx_YY.mo files of other localized WP installs in the folder wp-content/languages/. For example, here a list for a trilingual website (english, french, german : fr_FR.mo, de_DE.mo.
See this [codex page](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language) *about WP in your language* to find kit containing wanted files.

Since 2.8.8, xili-language is able to help you to download admin translation files from Automattic and GlotPress site. See the 4th tab in settings. For official embedded themes ( Twentyten and others), the .mo files can also be downloaded.

* Better dashboard post UI to create linked post (and page): *from one post, it possible to create linked post in another language and the links are prefilled. Just need to save draft to save the links between root and translated posts filled by authors.* [See](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=1498)
* fixes lost languages's link when trash or untrash (WP 2.9.1).

== 2. Flags ==
Default flags provided in bundled child themes like TwentyFourteen-xili [2014](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org/) came from [famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/). To be compliant to the design and look, choose your own series of flags. Be aware of size and file naming.

== 3. Compatibility ==

xili-language is compatible with the plugin [xili-dictionary](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-dictionary/) which is able to deliver .mo files on the fly through the WP admin UI (and .po files translatable by other translators). [xili-dictionary](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-dictionary/) used a specific taxonomy without adding tables in WP database.

xili-language is compatible with the plugin [xili-tidy-tags](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-tidy-tags/ ). xili-tidy-tags lets you create multiple group of tags. That way, you can have a tag cloud for tags in English, another cloud for French tags, another for Spanish ones, and so on. You can also use the plugin for more than multilingual blogs. Basically, you can create any group of tags you want.

xili-language is full compatible with the plugin [xilitheme-select](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xilitheme-select/ "xilitheme-select") to be used with iPhone, iPod Touch or other mobiles. Also with [xili re/un-attach media](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-re-un-attach-media/) !
